(www.knovatekinc.com) and save it in a structured format, and (2) utilize the scraped data to answer user queries about the website content.
 
*Note:*
1. You can create any number of agents to complete the task. Creative solutions using AutoGen and RAG are also welcome.
2. Please use your own GPT key for this task.
3. There is no need to submit your keys to GitHub for this task.
 
*Input:*
- *Task 1:* URL of the webpage.
- *Task 2:* Any query regarding the scraped data.
 
*Output:*
- *Task 1:* JSON file with scraped data.
- *Task 2:* Answer to questions regarding Knovatek Inc's homepage.
 
*Submission:*

*Task Overview:*
 
- *Agent 1: Data Scraping and Storage Agent*
 - This agent is responsible for receiving a website URL from the user, scraping content from the website, 
and storing the scraped data in a structured JSON format. The agent should ensure the data is stored in a manner 
that facilitates efficient retrieval and processing for answering user queries.
 
- *Agent 2: Query Answering Agent*
 - This agent will interact with a database to fetch relevant information in response to user queries about the website content. 
For this task, use any vector database solution for storing and querying the scraped data.
